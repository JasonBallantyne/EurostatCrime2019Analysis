# EurostatCrime2019Analysis

We will be using the EurostatCrime2019.csv for this analysis. This dataset records offences (values per hundred thousand inhabitants) by offence category in 41 European Countries in 2019. Full information on the dataset is available here: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/crim_off_cat_esms.htm
 
In task 1 we will **Manipulate** the dataset. In task 2 we will *Analyse* the dataset and finally in task 3 we add a **Creative** component to illustrate something we have not discovered with this dataset.
